python version 3.8+
nltk==3.8.1
groq==0.5.0
sentence-transformers==2.6.1
numpy==1.26.4

# ---- Core NLP & Sentiment Analysis ----
nltk==3.8.1

# ---- LLM Provider (Groq API Client) ----
groq==0.5.0

# ---- Optional / Recommended for Stability ----
requests==2.31.0

# ---- If VADER Lexicon needs download ----
# Run these manually if needed:
# python -m nltk.downloader vader_lexicon

1. nltk

Used for VADER sentiment analysis engine
Your code calls:

from nltk.sentiment import SentimentIntensityAnalyzer


So nltk is mandatory.

2. groq

Used to integrate LLaMA-3.1-8B via Groq API.

from groq import Groq


This is the lightweight SDK that sends chat-completion requests.

3. requests

Some environments require it for robust networking; Groq internally uses it.


How to Install All Dependencies

Run:

pip install -r requirements.txt


Then download VADER lexicon (once):

python -m nltk.downloader vader_lexicon


External Libraries:
1. nltk

Used for VADER sentiment analysis
Your code uses:

from nltk.sentiment import SentimentIntensityAnalyzer

2. groq

Used to access Groq LLaMA-3.1-8B model API.

from groq import Groq

3. requests (optional but recommended)

Sometimes required for stable API communication (Groq uses it internally).

Standard Python Libraries Used (Built-in, NO installation required)

json

For memory storage (user_memory.json, chat_sessions.json)

os

File paths, environment variables

re

Regex for sentiment/intent/name extraction

datetime

Timestamping chat sessions

typing

Type hinting like List, Dict, Tuple

random

Used to choose replies without repetition

math (implicitly used through numeric processing)
